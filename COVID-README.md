This project is used to explore the COVID-19 reported statistics from countries across the globe.

In SQL, I explored the data, broke down various bits of info for the United States specifically, as well as broke it down by individual continent

I explored the data between individual countries with regard to death rates and vaccination rates, showing trends and spikes in specfic areas and time periods

Original data set downloaded here:

# This is an ongoing project
I seek to polish and expand as there is so much data available and different relationships to look at
